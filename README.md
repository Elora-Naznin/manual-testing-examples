# 🧪 Manual Testing Examples

This repository contains real-world examples of **Manual Testing Techniques** used in Software Quality Assurance (SQA). These techniques are essential for identifying edge cases, verifying user flows, and ensuring application behavior is consistent with requirements.

## 🧠 Included Testing Techniques

### 📌 1. Equivalence Class Partitioning (ECP)
Divides input data into partitions to reduce the total number of test cases while still maintaining good coverage.

📁 [View Example](./Equivalence-Class-Partitioning/ECP-Example.xlsx)

---

### 📌 2. Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)
Focuses on testing at the boundaries between partitions. Most defects occur at the edges.

---

### 📌 3. Decision Table Testing
Creates test cases based on different combinations of inputs and their corresponding outputs.

---

### 📌 4. State Transition Testing
Used when a system behaves differently based on current state or past history.

### 📌 5. Use Case Testing
Ensures all steps in user flows (use cases) are working as expected.
